A video sequence stored in the YUV format is stored  by concatenating
consecutive frames into a single big file. Each frame contains the Y pixels 
for that frame first, followed by the U pixels (actually Cr pixel), followed 
by V pixels (actually Cb pixels). Each component is raster-scanned from 
the top left corner down to the bottom right corner. 
Each pixel value is stored as a 8 bit unsigned character.

For example, a frame in a QCIF sequence with 176x144 Y pixels and 
88x72 U and V pixels is stored in the following order:

           176
     +-------------+
     |             |
     |     Y       | 144
     |             |
     |             |
     +-------------+
       88
     +------+
     |  U   |
     |      |72
     +------+
     |  V   |
     |      |72
     +------+
