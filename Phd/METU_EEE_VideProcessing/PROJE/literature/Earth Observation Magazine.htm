                  <P><FONT size=5><B>D</B></FONT>ifferential GPS has greatly 
                  increased the productivity of aerial survey operations in 
                  recent years. With a sufficient number of satellites in view, 
                  DGPS is now capable of delivering position fixes rapidly and 
                  reliably to accuracies of a few centimeters using carrier 
                  phase techniques. This capability enables the surveyor to move 
                  quickly from point to point-maintaining positioning accuracies 
                  to within survey standards while operating "on the fly" (OTF). 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still further gains in 
                  survey productivity can be realized by combining DGPS with 
                  precision inertial sensors. A system that combines DGPS with 
                  inertial offers full 6 degree-of-freedom, high-accuracy 
                  position and orientation solution (position + roll, pitch, 
                  heading), high rate outputs (200 samples per second), and 
                  continuity of data through GPS 
                  outages.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These features 
                  provide the user with the capability to survey reliably from 
                  rapidly moving platforms. In addition, very high pointing 
                  accuracy can be achieved by combining carrier-phase 
                  differential GPS and precision inertial. With accurate 
                  orientation (angle) measurements available, high-resolution 
                  imaging sensors can be used to map the terrain remotely to 
                  survey-level accuracy. Large gains in surveying productivity 
                  can be realized in this way. Examples of such applications 
                  include high-altitude terrain mapping with scanning lasers and 
                  airborne photogrammetry using precision cameras. </P>
                  <P><B>Conventional Photogrammetry and Aerotriangulation 
                  </B><BR>Conventional photogrammetry entails constructing an 
                  accurate terrain model or topographic map from airborne 
                  photography acquired using large-format precision film 
                  cameras. The basic approach is to acquire a series of photos 
                  of the terrain, with exposures timed such that each photo 
                  overlaps the previous by about 60% in the track direction. 
                  Typically, a grid pattern is flown so that photos taken on 
                  each line also overlap photos acquired on parallel adjacent 
                  lines by about 30%. Cross lines must also be flown to provide 
                  additional redundancy. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
                  outlined below, stereo images (analog or digital) are 
                  constructed from the overlapping photos by using ground 
                  control points and common reference points appearing in the 
                  imagery to determine the correct orientation of each photo. 
                  Measurements of the position coordinates and elevations of 
                  ground features are derived from the stereo images. Maps are 
                  then generated from these 
                  data.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to construct 
                  the stereo images and to reference these images to the Earth, 
                  the position and orientation parameters of the camera at the 
                  time of each exposure must first be determined. This is done 
                  using a procedure called aerotriangulation. Here, with ground 
                  control established at key locations in the survey area, the 
                  photos in which the ground control points appear are processed 
                  to determine the camera position and orientation parameters 
                  corresponding to these photos. In principle, this involves 
                  measuring the photo-coordinates of the control points and then 
                  solving a set of simultaneous equations with the position and 
                  orientation parameters as unknowns. Having established the 
                  position and orientation parameters for the controlled photos, 
                  the control is transferred from photo to photo by "bridging" 
                  through common points or features appearing in overlapping 
                  photos. The end result is a mosaic of photos whose relative 
                  orientations (with respect to each other) and absolute 
                  orientations (with respect to the Earth) are known. The 
                  process of construction of the photo mosaic is labor-intensive 
                  and time-consuming. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
                  final step, stereo pairs of photos are processed to measure 
                  the Earth-referenced coordinates of height contours and 
                  terrain features. Here, the Earth-referenced coordinates of 
                  the measured points are determined from the corresponding 
                  photo-coordinate measurements using triangulation and 
                  knowledge of the position and orientation parameters of each 
                  photo. Typical accuracies achieved through aerotriangulation 
                  are in the range of 1 part in 5,000 to 1 part in 10,000, 
                  depending on map classification. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This corresponds to an 
                  on-the-ground positioning accuracy of 10centimeters to 20cm 
                  from a flying height of 1,000 meters. Expressed as an angle, 
                  1:10,000 corresponds to an accuracy of about 20 arc seconds in 
                  the absolute orientation of the photos. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of performing 
                  aerotriangulation, including establishing ground control, is 
                  estimated as $30 to $50 per stereo model. Typically, a medium 
                  to large size airborne survey company will process from 5,000 
                  to 10,000 stereo-models per year or more for a total cost of 
                  $150,000 to $500,000. </P>

                  of integrated GPS inertial products designed for remote 
                  mapping, surveying, and precision motion compensation 
                  applications. This product line is referred to collectively as 
                  POS, standing for Position and Orientation System. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A POS model specifically 
                  designed for airborne photogrammetry<BR>applications was 
                  introduced in 1997-referred to as POS/DG (Direct 
                  Georeferencing). POS/DG is a precision integrated GPS inertial 
                  system designed specifically to replace aerotriangulation in 
                  airborne photogrammetry. POS/DG provides this capability by 
                  measuring the position and orientation parameters of the 
                  aerial camera so that the relative and absolute orientations 
                  of the acquired photography can be determined to sufficient 
                  accuracy with minimal use of ground control and bridging 
                  points. The coordinates of ground points, height contours, 
                  etc., can then be measured directly from the stereophotography 
                  avoiding aerotriangulation altogether. </P>

                  Positions logged from a dual frequency GPS base-station are 
                  used for differential corrections. The inertial and GPS data 
                  are blended using a Kalman filter configured typically with 22

                  velocity, and attitude errors of the inertial solution and the 
                  residual sensor biases, scale factor, and alignment errors. 
                  These estimates are fed back to the inertial navigation

                  using GPS and inertial measurements that occur prior to and at 
                  the time-of-validity of each estimate. Backward time 
                  processing incorporates GPS and inertial measurements into the 
                  computations that occur after the time-of-validity of each 
                  estimate so as to improve overall estimation accuracy. An 
                  optimal recursive smoother is used for this purpose. Accuracy 
                  improvements realized by smoothing can be very significant 
                  with improvement factors ranging from about 2 to 10 depending 
                  on the mission profile and dynamic environment. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WGS-84 reference 
                  ellipsoid is employed in forward and backward time processing 
                  of the data. On completion of backward processing, the 
                  computed camera position and orientation parameters are 
                  transformed from WGS-84 into the local survey coordinate 
                  system. This transformation includes conversion of the three 
                  orientation angles-roll, pitch, and heading-to the three 
                  rotations employed in photogrammetry. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this transformation, 
                  a file is output containing the six camera orientation 
                  parameters at the time of each exposure. This file is input to 
                  the photogrammetry process (digital or analog) to construct 
                  stereo models from the acquired imagery. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software that implements 
                  the functions described above is bundled with POS/DG. This 
                  application-called POSPac-runs on a PC under Windows 95/98/NT. 
                  It provides: data extraction tools (to extract data from the 
                  flight disk); graphical user interface; processing and display 
                  tools; optimal aided inertial navigator processing, both 
                  forward and backward time; differential code-phase and 
                  carrier-phase GPS processing (GRAFNAV from Waypoint); 
                  coordinate conversion from WGS 84 to local mapping frame; and 
                  plot file generation and graphical display. 
                  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hour of recorded data 
                  will typically take a little less than 1 hour to post-process 
                  with POSPac on a 266Mhz Pentium-II laptop with 64MB of RAM.

                  <P><B>Results</B> <BR>Results of flight trials conducted using 
                  an RC30 camera are described here. In these tests, the POS/DG 
                  IMU was mounted on the RC30 camera and flown over the Ohio 
                  State test range. A total of 62 ground controls were used. 
                  Flying height was 2,400 feet. A pair of Ashtech Z-12 GPS 
                  receivers were used-one installed in the aircraft and the 
                  other as the base-station. </P>
                  <P><B>"On-the-Ground"- POS/DG vs. Ground Control </B><BR>In 
                  this test, residual measurements from 62 ground control points 
                  were selected. POS/DG position and orientation data were used 
                  to directly compute the "on-the-ground" coordinates of the 62 
                  surveyed reference points. </P>
                  <P><B>Conclusions </B><BR>The flight trial results presented 
                  here demonstrate that POS/DG provides accuracies comparable to 
                  that of conventional aerotriangulation in measurement of 
                  camera position and orientation-position accuracy better than 
                  20cm (RMS) per axis and orientation accuracy better than 30 
                  arc seconds (RMS) per axis. An accuracy of 20cm to 35cm (RMS) 
                  per axis was achieved in directly georeferencing ground points 
                  from a flying height of 2,500 feet. This is well within 
                  photo-mapping standards defined for the majority of 
                  applications. POS/DG is now being flown operationally by a 
                  rapidly increasing number of users providing benefits through 
                  reduced operational costs and faster turn-around times.</P>
