<H2>Computing Voronoi Skeletons of a 3-D Polyhedron by Space Subdivision </H2>
<H3><A href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~michals">Michal Etzion</A> and <A 
href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir">Ari Rappoport</A> </H3>We tackle the 
problem of computing the Voronoi diagram of a linear 3-D polyhedron. The main 
difficulty with the computation is that the diagram's edges and vertices are of 
relatively high algebraic degrees. As a result, previous approaches to the 
problem have been non-robust, difficult to implement, or not provenly correct. 
<P>We introduce three new proximity skeletons related to the Voronoi diagram: 
(1) the <I>Voronoi Graph (VG)</I>, which contains the complete symbolic 
information of the Voronoi diagram without containing any geometry; (2) the 
<I>Approximate Voronoi Graph (AVG)</I>, which deals with degenerate diagrams by 
collapsing sub-graphs of the VG into single nodes; and (3) the <I>Proximity 
Structure Diagram (PSD)</I>, which enhances the VG with a geometric 
approximation of Voronoi elements to any desired accuracy. The new skeletons are 
important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Many applications that 
extract the proximity information of the object from its Voronoi diagram can use 
the Voronoi graphs or the PSD instead. In addition, the skeletons can be used as 
initial structures for a robust and efficient global or local computation of the 
Voronoi diagram. 
<P>We present a space subdivision algorithm to construct the new skeletons, 
having three main advantages. First, it solves at most uni-variate quartic 
polynomials. This stands in sharp contrast to previous approaches, which require 
the solution of a non-linear tri-variate system of equations. Second, the 
algorithm enables purely local computation of the skeletons in any limited 
region of interest. Third, the algorithm is simple to implement.
