<H2>A Boundary Sampling Algorithm for Computing the Voronoi Graph of a 2-D 
Polygon </H2>
<H3><A href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~michals">Michal Etzion</A> and <A 
href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir">Ari Rappoport</A> </H3>The <I>Voronoi 
graph</I> of a set of sites contains the complete symbolic information of the 
Voronoi diagram of the sites without the latter's geometry. The Voronoi graph is 
important for two reasons. First, there are applications that need only the 
symbolic proximity information of a shape, without requiring geometry. Second, 
the graph can be used as a starting structure for a robust and efficient global 
or local computation of the Voronoi diagram. 
<P>In this paper we present an algorithm that computes the Voronoi graph of a 
2-D polygon (with holes) by generating the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of 
points on the polygon's boundary. Unlike algorithms for computing the Voronoi 
diagram of a polygon, our algorithm avoids manipulation of non-linear entities 
and is simple to implement. The operations used by the algorithm are line 
intersections and comparisons of distances between points and lines.
