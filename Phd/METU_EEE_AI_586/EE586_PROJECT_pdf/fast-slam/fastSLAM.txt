The solution of the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key prerequisite for truly autonomous robots, as well as a question important for our understansing of how real animals orient in space. If the map of the environment is known, estimating the path of the robot inside the environment is a straightforward task. Similarly, if the true path of the robot is known, constructing a map is a relatively simple task. However when both the exact path and the environment are unknown the during environment exploration, which is a typical situation of animals in natural conditions, the map and the path should be estimated simultaneously and online. A solution for this problem was recently proposed in the field of autonomous robotics and is called FastSLAM algorithm [1]. This algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that tracks simultaneously many hypotheses about the robot's position with respect to a set of observed landmarks. The hypotehses are constantly created and abandoned according to newly observed data. The algorithm is able to process maps with millions of features in a reasonable time, which is suitable for models of animal self-localization with realistic visual input. 

The goal of the project is to implement and analyse the FastSLAM algorithm for a simulated Khepera robot [2]. The analysis should be related to the possibility of the algorithm implementation by biologically plausible mechanisms as well as its potential importance for animal models of self-localization.
