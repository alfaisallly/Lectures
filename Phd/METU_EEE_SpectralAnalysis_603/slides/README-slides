This note describes two sets of overhead transparencies that are available 
as lecture notes to accompany "Introduction to Spectral Analysis" by 
P. Stoica and R. Moses.


SET 1: sm-slides.ps

This set of slides covers the six chapters of the text.  The slides are 
divided into nine lectures, one each for Chapters 1, 3, and 5, and two each 
for Chapters 2, 4, and 6.  We highlight the main topics of the text, but do 
not delve into detailed derivations; nor do we cover the Complements and 
Appendices.  The slides provide a compact overview of the text that can be 
covered in nine lectures.  There are a total of 125 pages.

The available files are:
sm-slides.ps:      postscript file of the slides, one to a page
sm-slides-2up.ps   postscript file of the slides, two to a page.



SET 2: li-slides.ps

This set of slides gives a more extensive coverage of Chapters 1 to 4 of 
the text.  It covers topics from the complements (such as Burg method, 
maximum entropy, and linear prediction) and from the Appendices (solving 
linear equations, and basic notions of estimation theory), which Set 1 does 
not cover.  In addition, Set 2 contains brief discussions of DSP 
fundamentals and Wiener filtering (viewed as an application of Spectral 
Analysis), which were not included in the text.  However Set 2 does not 
cover Chapters 5 and 6 of the text.  A course aiming at presenting the SA 
area in a more extensive way than afforded by Set 1 could use Set 2 for 
Chapters 1-4 and Set 1 for Chapters 5 and 6 (such a coverage of the subject 
may need 30 lectures).

Set 2 has been produced by Professor Jian Li (University of Florida) who
taught a SA course using several preliminary versions of our text. We
are grateful to her for making these slides available to us and our readers.
